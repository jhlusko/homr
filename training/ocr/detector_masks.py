"""
Turn detection boxes into per-pixel label masks, in the shape homr's own segmentation
model already expects.

27.68 found the detector half of 27.45 was never built and readied its data as a box list.
A box list is not yet something a model can train on; homr already has a proven answer for
"find small objects on a large, mostly-blank sheet-music page" - `homr/segmentation` runs a
U-Net over 320x320 patches tiled across the full-resolution page with 50% overlap, and
recovers noteheads and staff lines from the predicted per-pixel class map by connected
components (`inference_segnet.extract`). A lyric syllable at a measured median 34x16 pixels
(27.44) is exactly the kind of target that pattern was built for, and one page downsampled
to a single fixed size would lose it entirely.

**This module produces the same shape of target the existing segmentation model trains
against - a per-pixel class mask - not a new architecture.** The model itself is a decision
left open in 27.68; this is the data step ahead of it, and it is testable on CPU.

**Class 0 is always background.** Classes 1..N follow `CLASS_ORDER`, a fixed list rather
than derived from whatever appears in one manifest - a mask's channel meaning has to be
stable across every image it is compared against or stitched from, and a set's iteration
order is not a contract.

**Overlap is resolved by drawing in a fixed priority order, later drawn over earlier.**
Two boxes overlapping is rare in engraved music - text does not print on top of itself -
but not impossible at a box's edge from measurement slack, and silently ignoring the
question would leave the tie-break to dictionary order, which is not documented and not
stable.
