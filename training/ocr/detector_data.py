"""
Build the detector's training set - and record why it did not exist until now.

27.45 chose detection then recognition, and only the second half got built. Every crop the
recogniser has ever been trained or measured on came from MuseScore's own SVG boxes -
ground truth. Nothing in this project yet locates a syllable on a page it has not already
been told the layout of. A page from a real scan carries no such boxes, so the recogniser as
it stands cannot be pointed at one.

This is that gap's data half: one row per box, image path, class name, and the box itself,
built from the `.boxes.json` corpus `musescore_boxes.py` already produces. It needs no
string - detection only has to find and classify a region, which is why lyric boxes and the
unpaired classes of 27.44 (Dynamic excluded, per 27.45: it is a music glyph, not text) can
train the same detector even though only lyrics carry a label to recognise afterwards.

**Class balance is reported, not fixed here.** 27.62 measured what an imbalanced classifier
does without correction - it stops predicting the rare class - and a detector with `Lyrics`
in the thousands against `Tempo` in the tens would show the identical failure. The fix
27.62 validated (focal loss) is a property of the detector's own loss, not of this export;
recording the imbalance here is what would make that decision visible before it is trained
into a blind spot.
