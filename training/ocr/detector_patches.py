Sample 320x320 training patches biased toward the boxes, not tiled uniformly across the page.

27.69 measured text coverage at 0.38% of a page. homr's own segmentation training
(`training/segmentation/dense_dataset_definitions.py`) tiles a plain non-overlapping grid of
320x320 patches across the whole page with no bias toward content, which is right for its
own targets - noteheads and staff lines are dense enough that most tiles contain some. Text
is not: a typical page here holds around 13 boxes (27.68 - 37,356 boxes over 2,847 images),
and a 4500x3200 page tiles into on the order of 140 non-overlapping 320x320 windows, so an
unbiased grid would put text in a handful of tiles and nothing in the rest. Copying homr's
sampler here would train a detector almost entirely on the answer "nothing here" - which
28.62's global-focal mistake already showed happens by accident when a correction is applied
somewhere it was not measured to be needed; this is the same trap approached from the data
side, avoided by measuring first rather than reusing a pattern built for different data.

**Sampling, not tiling.** Each drawn patch is centred either on a randomly chosen box (with
jitter, so a box is not always dead-centre) or on a uniformly random page location, at a
fixed ratio - the positive samples give the loss something to learn from every step, the
negative samples keep the model from predicting text everywhere out of habit.

Edge padding follows the convention already set for this corpus: white for the image (paper,
not ink - 27.51's recogniser found the alternative teaches the model that every crop ends in
a black bar), background class for the mask.
