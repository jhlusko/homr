"""Rewrite implied tuplets in a transcription arithmetically, rather than learning them.

An implied tuplet is engraved with no bracket and no numeral - 19th-century printing does
this freely, and it is the model's largest single error class: 84% of rhythm errors are a
tuplet written as plain values. Training data barely moves it, and cannot be expected to.
Raising tuplet supply 70% cut tuplet-token errors ~6% and produced no additional correct
staves. That is the right result for the wrong-looking reason: where the tuplet is
*implied* there is nothing in the pixels to read, so no quantity of examples teaches it.

The arithmetic, however, is decidable without the image. If a bar overruns its staff's
prevailing bar by exactly (written - sounded) * d, and holds a run of `written` values of
duration d, then rewriting that run as a tuplet makes the bar exact. Nothing else produces
that signature, which is what makes this a symbolic pass rather than a model deficiency.

Two constraints keep it honest:

* **Single staves only.** `group_into_chords` attributes a simultaneity's duration once, so
  on a grand staff a bar's total is neither the sum of the hands nor either hand's own
  length (see `is_single_staff`). The premise "this bar is overfull" is not evaluable
  there, so the caller must not offer one.
* **Unambiguous rewrites only.** Where two different tuplets both make the bar exact, the
  arithmetic does not identify which was engraved, and `require_unique` declines rather
  than guessing. This costs recall and is worth it: a wrong rewrite corrupts durations
  that were already right.
